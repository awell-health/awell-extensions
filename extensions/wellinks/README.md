# Wellinks Extension

The purpose of this extension is to keep application logic out of the Pathways and Tracks. Some actions require interactions with the Healthie API, hence the need for the API URL and Key in the settings.

## Extension Settings

You will need to provide the API URL and Key for the Wellinks Healthie instance.

# Custom Actions

## Check for Override

Checks to see if the patient in Healthie has an active Override form.
