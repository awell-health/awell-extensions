# What is Gridspace

Gridspace is a conversational speech bot platform using its proprietary AI, Grace. It was built for long-form conversations over the phone, which distinguishes her from other voice AIs such as Siri and Alexa.

Grace can perform an an ever-increasing variety of service-oriented tasks across multiple roles. Grace's job functions include, but are by no means limited to:
- Healthcare Scheduler
- Lead Qualifier
- Payments Facilitator
- After-hours Phone Operator
- Service Appointment Booker

Grace has the ability to manage customer service and patient care interactions independently from start to finish, or she can work in collaboration with human agents.
