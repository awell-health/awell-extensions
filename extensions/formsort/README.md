# Formsort

Formsort is a fully-managed form-building platform. Team can use the online studio (a specialized content management system for forms) to create form content, modify styles, and configure integrations.

Formsort hosts your fully-branded forms, either on one of your subdomains or embedded in a page on your site. When responders submit answers, Formsort sends the answers to a destination of your liking directly. Formsort doesn't store the responder's answers. 

## Flow settings

In order for the flows to work well with Awell care flows, make sure your flow settings are set as follows:

- There should be no redirects
- "Start each session as a new responder" should be checked
- "Enable URL navigation" should be disabled
- "Enable restart once flow completed" should be disabled
- "Enable close once flow completed" should be disabled

## Custom Actions

### Complete flow

Let a stakeholder complete a Formsort flow from within Awell Hosted Pages.

**Limitations:**
Currently data from the flow is not ingested into Awell yet and cannot be used in your care flow as data points.
