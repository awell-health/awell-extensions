# Zus Health

[Zus Health](https://zushealth.com/) is the only shared health data platform designed to accelerate healthcare data interoperability by providing easy-to-use patient data at the point of care via API, embedded components, and direct EHR integrations.

## Zus Health x Awell

This extension allows you to fetch resource via webhooks

## Extension settings

For the extension to function correctly, you must include the following elements in your settings:

`client_id` and `client_secret`: These values are generated on the Zus Health platform.
`base_url`: This determines the base URL for your FHIR endpoint, for example, https://api.sandbox.zusapi.com/fhir.
`auth_url`: This determines the base URL for your authorization endpoint, for example, https://zus-sandbox.us.auth0.com/oauth/token.
`audience`: This determines the API hostname, for example, https://api.sandbox.zusapi.com.

## Webhooks

Webhooks offer a great way to listen to updates to resources in Zus and trigger Awell care flows. These updates include ADT feed events for your patient population, and the relevant Encounter data can then be incorporated in the new flow.
