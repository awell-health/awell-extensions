# Workramp

Workramp is a learning management platform helping to upskill employees and educate partners and customers.

## Extension settings

There are no extension settings (e.g. API keys) to set. Simply enable the extension and then utilize the EventPayload webhook to subscribe to events.

## Webhooks

### EventPayload
Listens to an event and starts a care flow, using the `user.id` field as a unique patient identifier.

To learn more about webhooks, visit [their developer site](https://developers.workramp.com/reference/introduction-to-webhooks).
