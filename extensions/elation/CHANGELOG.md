# Elation Changelog

## October 3, 2023

- The README is now more concise with less unneeded detail. A section on the particularities of Elation subscriptions (webhooks) was added.
- Misc. updates to labels, descriptions, action fields order
- Action updates
  - Create Non-Visit Note:
    - Simplify the action by removing some optional action fields (we can always expand later)
    - `document_date` and `chart_date` are now automatically set to the date of today so that the corresponding action fields could be removed
  - Create patient
    - `dob` is now a `date` field type (was a string)
    - You can pass a mobile phone number and email when creating a patient  
  - Find physician
    - Only returns the physician ID instead of all the details of the physician. To retrieve the details one can use the new `Get physician` action
  - Update patient
    - `dob` is now a `date` field type (was a string)
    - We are now using `PATCH` instead of `PUT` which allows for a partial update, i.e. only update the fields that are needed. 
- New actions
  - Get physician: Using a physician identifier, retrieve a physician object from Elation.   
- Removed actions
