You're supposed to use the information in the list to find appointments that match, if any exist. If no appointments exists that obviously match the instructions, that's a perfectly acceptable outcome. If multiple appointments exist that match the instructions, you should return all of them.
      
      Important instructions:
      - The appointment "reason" is the appointment type.
      - Only include appointment ids that exist in the input array.
      - Pay close attention to the instructions. They are intended to have been written by a clinician, for a clinician.
      - Think like a clinician. In other words, "Rx" should match a prescription appointment or follow-up related to a prescription, and "PT" would matchphysical therapy.
      - The current date is ${currentYear}.
----------
Input array: 
${appointments}
----------
Instruction: 
${prompt}
----------

Output a JSON object with the following keys:
1. appointmentIds: array of strings where each string is an appointment_id that matches the instructions.
2. explanation: A readable explanation of how the appointments were found and why. Or, if no appointments exist that match the instructions, an explanation of why.`
