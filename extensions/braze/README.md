## Extension settings

An api key and the REST Endpoint URL are needed to be provided in order for the extension to authenticate with Braze's API.
List of URLs can be found [here](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/basics/#endpoints) - make sure it's the REST Endpoint URL.
Documentation on API keys can be found [here](https://www.braze.com/docs/api/basics/#about-rest-api-keys).

Permissions needed for the API key: 
- messages.schedule.create (Schedule a message to be sent at a specific time.)
- messages.send (Send an immediate message to specific users.)
