# Signup Completed Webhook

When a new patient completes the Tia Signup flow, the "Annual Preventative Exam" care flow will automatically start for them.

The Tia Signup flow is managed by the Tia System (orchestrated by the Tia server). Once the signup process is completed, Tia will send a POST request to the webhook endpoint generated by this webhook listener. This request will trigger the start of the care flow.

## Payload

The request payload will include at minimum the Tia User ID of the newly registered patient. This ID will be used to assign and initiate the care flow for that patient.
