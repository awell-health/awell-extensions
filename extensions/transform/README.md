# Transform

Transform is an extension on Awell's Marketplace with utility functions that allows you to transform data from one type to another. These functions are particularly useful e.g. when system A works with IDs that are numbers but system B works with IDs that are strings.

### Parse text to number

### Parse date to unix timestamp

### Parse unix timestamp to unix date
