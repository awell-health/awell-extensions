## v2

Compared to v1 (pre-beta release), the extension only has one custom action "Send SMS" instead of two. The Custom Action allows for:

1. Sending a text message to a recipient (phone number) stored in a data point, including patient profile data points.
2. Sending a text message to a fixed recipient (phone number).
