# Calendly changelog

## November 3, 2023

- Calendly webhooks for event created, canceled and rescheduled are now supported.

## November 20, 2023

- Removed rescheduled event; expectation is that the rescheduling should be handled on the client side, given Calendly does not direcly support a rescheduled webhook
